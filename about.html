          BluZoo is an artist collective specializing in video, website design, installation, and new media art.
          While our members live and work in Japan, China, U.K., we collaborate virtually.
          We bring together a diverse set of training backgrounds, ranging from filmmaking, architecture, literature, philosophy, to computer science.
          Since its foundation in May 2020, BluZoo has put on two exhibits in Tokyo, and booked three other exhibits in Japan and China.

                Through art I recreate these haunting moments as shareable narratives and spaces, where 
                the cultural and social structures that produced these discomforts become visible and questionable. 
                Using my personal experience as the portal and with the visceral connection that art innately creates with its audience, 
                I seek to open and foster a dialogue about emotions and stories ; not from an objective distance, but from the understanding and intimacy of shared pain.
